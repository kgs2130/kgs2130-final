        <h2 class="header">Assignments for ENGI1006 Spring Semester 2020</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Homework 1A: </b>This assignment asked students to work
            with binary, complete conversions and truth tables, and write an
            algorithm for the amount of money in a bank account based on
            initial values and compounded interest.</li>
            <li><b>Homework 1B: </b>The first programming assignment, which
            asked students to create three functions plus a main function that
            return values based on the user input of their name. The second
            part dealt with list manipulation.</li>
            <li><b>Homework 2A: </b>This homework posed questions testing
            inderstanding of iterations, binary and sequential searches, and 
            time complexity. </li>
            <li><b>Homework 2B: </b>The first part of this assignment asked
            students to write functions for gravity, position, velocity,
            and overall trajectories in projectile motion. The second part was
            the started of the machine learning application, where the initial
            utility functions were written.</li>
            <li><b>Homework 3A: </b>This assignment asked students to write 
            pseudocode for add and union functions and provide their time
            complexity. The second part dealt with the recursive implementation 
            of functions. </li>
            <li><b>Homework 3B: </b>This homework involved writing a 
            percolation module using recursive functions to solve a vertical
            percolation problem first shown in class. The second part built on
            the machine learning application by adding functions that provided
            statistics about the given data set. </li>
            <li><b>Homework 4: </b>This homework asked students to model a
            classroom: generating and enrolling students, assignments, and
            calculating grades and the teacher's salary. </li>
            <li><b>Midterm: </b>This assignment dealt with the manipulation
            of images in the PPM format. Three functions were defined as
            methods through which images, which had additional parts that were
            out of place (a shark on a mountain range for example), could be
            restored. </li>
            <li><b>Homework 5: </b>The final homework assignment asked
            students to utilize pandas, seaborn, numpy, and scikitlearn to
            comeplete the machine learning library/application to provide more
            statistics and plot data, each method ultimately yielding a
            different level of accuracy between predicted and actual data sets.
            </li>
            <li><b>Final Project: </b>The final project for this class asked 
            students to use Flask, html, and css to generate and design a web 
            server. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="header">My Favorite Assignment from this Semester</h3>
        <p> Though I very much liked all of the assignments from this
        semester, I particularly enjoyed the machine learning project, as we
        were able to construct the whole thing from scratch, and apply a number
        of concepts we were learning throughout the course. I also really
        appreciated the practical nature of this assignment, and could see
        myself implementing this type of program in my career. <br><br>
        
        I also loved completing the final project, again due to the pragmatic
        nature of the assignment, but also because it offered so much freedom
        allowing me to develop, code, and create pages and layouts of
        my choosing.
